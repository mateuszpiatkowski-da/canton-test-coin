# Token Standard

This directory contains `dar` files generated using `daml` from the [Splice Token Standard](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/splice/tree/main/token-standard) DAML libraries as well as copied openapi `yaml` files.

## Generation

The DAML code in this directory was automatically generated based on the token standard definitions. To regenerate these files, use the DAML compiler with the Splice token standard as a dependency.
